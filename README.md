# Digital Timer

## Part A. Solder your LCD panel

**Take a picture of your soldered panel and add it here!**

## Part B. Writing to the LCD
 
**a. What voltage level do you need to power your display?** 5 V

**b. What voltage level do you need to power the display backlight?** 3.3 V
   
**c. What was one mistake you made when wiring up the display? How did you fix it?** Before I connected the arduino to the computer, when I was comparing my circuit to the given diagram, I realized that I had accidentally connected RS on the LCD to pin 11 (1011 on the diagram) instead of connecting it to pin 12. 

**d. What line of code do you need to change to make it flash your name instead of "Hello World"?** In void setup() I changed the line lcd.print("Hellow World"); to lcd.print("Vini Tripathii");
 
**e. Include a copy of your Lowly Multimeter code in your lab write-up.**
Please see repository for Multimeter code.

## Part C. Using a time-based digital sensor

**Upload a video of your working rotary encoder here.**


## Part D. Make your Arduino sing!

**a. How would you change the code to make the song play twice as fast?**
 
**b. What song is playing?**


## Part E. Make your own timer

**a. Make a short video showing how your timer works, and what happens when time is up!**

**b. Post a link to the completed lab report your class hub GitHub repo.**
